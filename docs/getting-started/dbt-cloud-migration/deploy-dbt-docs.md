# Deploy your dbt Docs

## Production dbt Docs 

Datacoves hosts your production docs and they are deployed via a CI/CD process with github actions. 

To configure this functionality:

**Step 1:** Head to your Environment Settings 

![Environment Menu](./assets/migration_environments.gif)

**Step 2:** Click `Stack Service` and turn on the `Observe > Local Docs Tab`. This will populate the `Docs settings` as seen below.

![Environment Observe Settings](./assets/migration_environment_observe_settings.gif)

Your designated docs branch has been set to `dbt-docs` for you.

**Step 3:** Head to Github and create a branch in your repo named `dbt-docs`. 
The service will not be available until you complete this step as seen in the image below.

**Step 4:** In Github, head to `repo settings > Actions > General` to ensure that Github Actions has Read and Write permission configured. This is needed to write to the dbt-docs branch.

**Step 5:** In Github, head to the `repo settings > Secrets and Variables > Actions` to add the following variables and secrets for your data warehouse credentials for production. These should be set for the repository not the environment.

| Type     | Name                               |
|----------|------------------------------------|
| variable | DB_ACCOUNT                         |
| variable | PROD_DATABASE                      |
| variable | DB_SCHEMA                          |
| variable | DB_ROLE                            |
| variable | DB_WAREHOUSE                       |
| variable | DB_USER                            |
| secret   | DB_PASSWORD                        |

**Step 6:** In your main branch, add a file at the root and type `.github/workflows/deploy-to-main.yml`. This will create the `deploy-to-main.yml` file inside of the `.github/workflows` folders. If your repository doesn't have a `.github/workflows`directory, go to the main page of the repository on GitHub, click Add file, then click Create new file, and name the file `.github/workflows/deploy-to-main.yml`. This creates the `.github` and `workflows` directories and the `deploy-to-main.yml` file in a single step.

**Step 7:** Copy the following code into the `deploy-to-main.yml` file:

```yml
name: Perform deployment to production

on:  # yamllint disable-line rule:truthy
  pull_request:
    types:
      - closed
    branches:
      - main

  # Allows you to run this workflow manually from the Actions tab
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:

  # Perform the deployment to Prod
  build:
    # Need to make sure that when the PR was closed, it was actually merged.
    if: github.event.pull_request.merged == true && github.event.pull_request.base.ref == 'main'

```
**Step 8:** Commit this change and select "Create a new branch and start a Pull request" and merge the pull request. This will trigger the action you just committed because it is set to run upon a closed PR to main.
