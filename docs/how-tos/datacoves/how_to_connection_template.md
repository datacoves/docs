### Each Connection Template consist of the following fields:

- **Name** This is the name users will see when selecting the base connection template when entering credentials for themselves or service accounts.
- **Enabled for users** This flag indicates whether this template will be available for users or only for service accounts. To simplify the end-user experience, it is best to show them only the primary template they should use when entering their credentials. If enabled, a new field will appear:

  - **User field configuration** Defines how the DB connection `Username` field will be treated. It can be `provided` by the end-user or inferred using two strategies: from his/her email, or based on templates.
    The difference in these approaches will be noticed when the final user creates their respective connections in `Settings -> Database connections`

    - **Provided by user** With this strategy, the user will have free access to write the desired username when creating a connection

    >[!TIP]We suggest not using the user-provided username if snowflake public key is automatically added to Snowflake by datacoves like:
    > `_alter user \<some_user\> set rsa_public_kay = '\<some_key\>';`

    - **Inferred from user's email** Defines the username field as read-only, pre-populating it with the user's email username (what comes before @domain.com)

    - **Inferred from user info using a custom template** With this last approach, you can choose a template from which the username will be generated. If selected a new field will appear to select one of those.

      By default we support `Connection username for admins` template. With this template, the username will see `admin_{{username}}` when creating a DB connection. Contact us to create a custom template for your account if you have different requirements.

- **Project** This defines the Datacoves project that should be associated with this connection template
- **Type** Defines the data warehouse provider so that users are presented the appropriate fields when entering their credentials.
- **Provider connection details** Based on the Provider Type selected, available default parameters will be displayed.

### For Snowflake, the available fields are: 

- `Account`: To locate this, visit your snowflake account > Click on the menu in the bottom left corner > Select the account > select the `Copy account identifier`. 
  
>[!ATTENTION]You must replace the `.`  with a `-` eg) `my.account` > `my-account` or you will get an error.
