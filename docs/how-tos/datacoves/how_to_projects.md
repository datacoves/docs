A Project configuration consists of the following fields:

- **Name** This is what will be displayed in the Datacoves landing page.
- **Git Repo** This is the git repository associated with this project
  - **Clone strategy** determines how Datacoves will communicate with your git repository(SSH or HTTPS). Each clone strategy is configured as follows:
    - **SSH** When SSH is selected, an SSH public Key will be automatically generated for you to configure in your git provider as a deployment key.

  - **Release branch** defines the default branch in your repository. This is typically `main` or `master`
- **CI/CD Provider** when provided, this will display a link to your CI/CD jobs on the Observe tab of a Datacoves environment. Once you choose your provider, you will be able to specify your `CI jobs home url`
