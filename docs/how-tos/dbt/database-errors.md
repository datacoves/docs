# How to Fix dbt Database Errors

Database errors occur when dbt tries to execute SQL that your database cannot process. These are among the most common errors and are typically straightforward to debug.

## Common Symptoms

- SQL syntax errors
- Invalid column references
- Table not found errors
- Data type mismatches
- Query timeout issues
- Resource constraints
- Permissions issues

## Solution Steps

### 1. Compile and Test SQL Directly

Use the compile command to see the actual SQL being generated:

```bash
dbt compile -s my_model
```

Then:
1. Copy the SQL and run it directly in your database client
2. Debug any syntax or reference issues in your data warehouse directly
3. Apply fixes to the dbt model

### 2. Check Compiled Model

Examine the compiled SQL:

- Correct table references
- Valid column names
- Proper SQL syntax
- Correct schema references

## Query Optimization Tips

### Common Performance Patterns

1. Replace subqueries with CTEs:

```sql
-- Instead of this
SELECT *
FROM table_a
WHERE id IN (SELECT id FROM table_b WHERE status = 'active')

-- Use this
WITH active_ids AS (
   SELECT id 
   FROM table_b 
   WHERE status = 'active'
)
SELECT *
FROM table_a
WHERE id IN (SELECT id FROM active_ids)
```

2. Use appropriate materialization:

```yaml
{{ config(
   materialized='incremental',
   unique_key='id',
   incremental_strategy='merge'
) }}
```
   
3. Check that `ref` and `source` macros compile as expected:

You can test that for a given target, dbt will generate the proper relation.

```bash
dbt compile --inline '{{ ref("us_population") }}' -t prd
```

This is especially useful if you are using Slim CI

```bash
dbt compile --inline '{{ ref("us_population") }}' --state logs --defer
```

## Best Practices

1. Always test complex SQL transformations in your database
2. Use CTEs to break down complex logic
3. Maintain consistent naming conventions
4. Document known database-specific limitations
5. Implement appropriate error handling
6. Use incremental processing for large datasets
7. Add dbt data and unit tests
8. Use your data warehouse query profiler or `EXPLAIN` query
9. Monitor query performance

## Prevention Steps

1. Set up monitoring and alerting
2. Implement CI/CD checks
3. Implement regular performance reviews
4. Implement Documentation policies and governance
5. Train team on database best practices

## Next Steps

If you continue to experience issues:

1. Review your database's documentation for specific limitations
2. Check for similar issues in the dbt-core repo, dbt Slack community, Reddit, Stack Overflow
3. Consider simplifying complex transformations
4. Verify data types across all referenced columns

Remember to always test changes in a development environment first and maintain proper documentation of any database-specific configurations or workarounds.
