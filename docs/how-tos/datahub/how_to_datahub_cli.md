# How to use DataHub's CLI from your VS Code terminal

Connecting to your DataHub instance via your VS Code terminal can be extremely useful for performing maintenance on your metadata, running ingestions, deleting data, and more.

## Configure DataHub CLI

### Setting the DataHub Host URL

To establish a secure connection to your DataHub server, follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal in VS Code and run the following command:

```bash
datahub init
```

2. When prompted, enter the DataHub host URL. This will differ depending on which environment your Datahub instance is in.

#### Development Environment 

If your Datahub instance is within the Development environment use:

```bash
http://{environment-slug}-datahub-datahub-gms:8080
```

#### Cross Environment 

You can access Datahub in Prod or QA from the Dev environment. This is considered cross environment access and requires the use the full url as seen below. The slug will be for the environment where Datahub is hosted (QA or Prod). 

```bash
http://<slug>-datahub-datahub-gms.dcw-<slug>:8080
```

>[!NOTE] The environment slug can be found next to your environment name on the top left corner of your Datacoves workspace. For example, the environment slug below is `DEV123`, so the URL would be: `http://dev123-datahub-datahub-gms:8080`.
